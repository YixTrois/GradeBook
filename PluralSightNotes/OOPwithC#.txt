Encapsulation(most important, key to good software design) : allow us to hide details about our code, 
methods and properties allow us to encapsulate code, 
access modifiers like public and private, give us explicit control over encapsulation and 
who sees the members of a class.
Inheritance(overrated): reuse code across similar classes
Polymorphism: allow us to have objects of the same type that can behave differently

any class would have a base class because .NET everything will derive from Object.
