reference type:
var b = new Book("Grades");
Memory
b: 1072(a value, represents a memory locatoin)
1072: the address of where the book is in the memory
doesn't contain the book

value type:
var x = 3;
runtime still creates space instead of storing a reference inside of the variable, i store the value itself, so there is no pointer to an integer.

convention for c#:
public member has an uppercase

the only difference between ref and out is that:

whenever you are working with something defined by a class, then it's a reference type


define struct: really small, a lot more efficient.
public struct Point
day to day business: 99% creating class instead of struct


string is always a reference type in c#

when we pass parameters, we always pass parameters by value in c#
